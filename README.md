Simple, multiple, and polynomial regression

1. Simple Linear 

You have a dataset (Salaries-Simple_Linear.csv) contains two columns: Years_of_Expertise and Salary. 

Your task is to find best fitting line that enables to estimate new salaries (y’s) based on the years of experience (x’s) to new hire employees using simple linear regression techniques!

2- Multiple 

You have a dataset (3-Products-Multiple.csv) contains four columns: Product_1, Product_2, Product_3, Location, and Profit. 

Your task is to build a model using Multiple Linear Regression technique that tells what factors (x’s) that affect profitability of a business. For example, investing more in the Product_1, Product_2, or Product_3 at a certain city (x’s) to maximize the profit (y’s)?

So, you have four features (Product_1, Product_2, Product_3, Location) will help you to build your model to predict the better profit could be obtained by investing more on a specific product at a particular city!  

3- Polynomial 

You have a dataset (Propose-Salaries-Polynomial.csv) contains three columns: Position, Level, and Salary. 

Your task is fitting the line that enables to estimate new salaries (y’s) based on the levels to new hire employees using the polynomial regression technique! Please assume that the level represents the position code (x’s), so you don’t need to use the position field during building your model! 

I want to find the estimate salary to a new hire employee at a level of 6.5!
